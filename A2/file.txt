Can be a very helpful technique. Why would you want to flush an output buffer? 
Usually when I do it, it's because the code is crashing and I'm trying to debug 
something. The standard buffer will not print everytime you call printf() it 
waits until it's full then dumps a bunch at once. So if you're trying to check 
if you're making it to a function call before a crash, it's helpful to printf 
something like "got here!", and sometimes the buffer hasn't been flushed 
before the crash happens and you can't tell how far you've really gotten.
